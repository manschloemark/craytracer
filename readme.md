C Ray Tracer
--

Simple project I am working on to implement what I have learned so far.

This project will help me practice C, architecture, graphics programming principles, and math.

This is largely based off of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend except in C rather than C++.
I am using the book as a reference rather than plainly copying it.
